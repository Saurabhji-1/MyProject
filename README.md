Hi,

The SurvivalDurationCalculator class calculates how long a person has lived based on their age, converting it into months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, or seconds.
The class includes methods for each time unit and displays the duration when prompted. The main function handles user input for age and desired time unit, ensuring valid entries.
The code has been corrected for constructor naming and formatting.

Thank you
